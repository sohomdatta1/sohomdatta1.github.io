## About Me

I am a senior (final year) pursuing my undergrad in Computer Science at Manipal Institute of Technology. My research interests include topics such as **web security**, **privacy measurement** and **systems security**.

In the formative years of my undergraduate degree, I have had the opportunity of gaining practical experience, working as a open-source developer and maintainer for projects such as [ProofreadPage](https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ProofreadPage) and [VideoCutTool](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/COM:VideoCutTool) at the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org), as well as interning at [Chromium](https://chromium.org) during 2022, where I worked on a [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2022/projects/Vqi9wYEF) aimed at increasing Chromium's coverage of the Performance API specification.

More recently, I have been involved in cybersecurity adjacent projects, acting as subsystem head specializing in web and binary security at my [college cybersecurity team](https://ctftime.org/team/62713/) (ranked amongst the top 10 in India in CTFTime during 2023) as well as being chosen for a undergraduate research assistantship advised by [Nisha P. Shetty](https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/nisha-p-shetty/_jcr_content.html).

As of March 2023, I am working as a Research intern at the [Wolfpack Privacy and Security Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/), North Carolina State University.

## Hobbies

When I'm not tinkering with tech, I like to spend my time doing photography and writing about [Indian topics at Wikimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sohom_Datta). I have a [instagram](https://instagram.com/dattasohom) where I infrequently post cool pictures that I might have taken.
