## Hobbies

When I'm not tinkering with tech, I like to spend my time doing photography and writing about [indian and computer security topics at Wikimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sohom_Datta). I have an instagram where I infrequently post cool pictures that I might have taken.
