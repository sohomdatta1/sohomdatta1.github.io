## Open-source experience

I co-maintain Wikimedia open-source projects like PageTriage, which helps combat spam articles, and the ProofreadPage and Wikisource extensions that are used in the Wikisource digital library. I also maintain a few other tools to optimize editor workflows. 

I also help maintain the [VisibleV8](https://github.com/wspr-ncsu/visiblev8) and [VisibleV8-crawler](https://) codebase as a PhD student who actively uses VisibleV8 in their research.



## Roles at Wikimedia

I currently serve as a member of the [Product and Technology Advisory Council](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Product_and_Technology_Advisory_Council/Proposal) (PTAC). I am an administrator on the English Wikipedia where I help fix technical problems and fight spam on wiki. I've previously served as a Google Summer of Code Mentor during 2021 and 2024 and a Google Summer of Code Organization administrator in 2023.

## Hobbies

When I'm not tinkering with tech, I like to spend my time doing photography and writing about [computer security topics at Wikimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sohom_Datta). I have an instagram where I infrequently post cool pictures that I might have taken.
