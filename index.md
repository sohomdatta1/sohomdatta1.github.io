## About Me

I am a recent grad, a software developer and cybersecurity enthusiast. I tend to gravitate towards topics such as **web security**, **systems security** and **privacy measurement**.

In the formative years of my undergraduate degree, I have had the opportunity of gaining practical experience, working as a open-source developer and maintainer for projects such as [ProofreadPage](https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ProofreadPage) and [VideoCutTool](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/COM:VideoCutTool) at the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org), as well as interning at [Chromium](https://chromium.org) during 2022, where I worked on a [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2022/projects/Vqi9wYEF) aimed at increasing Chromium's coverage of the Performance API specification.

More recently, I have been involved in cybersecurity adjacent projects, acting as subsystem head specializing in web and binary security at my [college cybersecurity team](https://ctftime.org/team/62713/) (ranked amongst the top 10 in India in CTFTime during 2023) as well as being chosen for a undergraduate research assistantship advised by [Nisha P. Shetty](https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/nisha-p-shetty/_jcr_content.html).

Towards the start of 2023, I had the privilege of working as a Research intern at the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/) working on improving the tooling around [VisibleV8](https://github.com/wspr-ncsu/visiblev8), a modified version of the Chrome browser that facilitates research into malicious and/or privacy infringing javascript on the web. In October 2023, I worked as a Visiting Researcher at the [Max Planck Institute of Security and Privacy](https://mpi-sp.org/), Bochum, where I pursued a project exploring the feasibility of fuzzing race-conditions in web-server application logic.

Since February 2023, I have taken up a position as a research scholar at the Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research Lab (again!) and will be working with Dr Alexandros Kapravelos's group to investigate Javascript techniques used in fingerprinting and other privacy compromising contexts. I am also in the process og transitioning to a PhD position at the same lab.

## Hobbies

When I'm not tinkering with tech, I like to spend my time doing photography and writing about [indian and computer security topics at Wikimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sohom_Datta). I have a [instagram](https://instagram.com/dattasohom) where I infrequently post cool pictures that I might have taken.
