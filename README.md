### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sohom Datta (aka `Soda` aka `Sodium`), a student at [Manipal Instiute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipal_Institute_of_Technology). I generally contribute to repositories that are related to the [Wikimedia movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia) in my capacity as a volunteer developer, though you may also find me hacking on other stuff depending on what I find really intresting or particularly frustrating during that time.

I also play Capture The Flag competitions both individually and as a part of my college team, [Cryptonite](https://github.com/Cryptonite-MIT) focussing on the web(-browser) security and binary exploitation categories.

My exact interests at any given time can be obtained by computing the absolute barometric pressure of `22.5726Â° N, 88.3639Â° E` at that exact instant and using that as the seed of a random number generator. :laughing:

#### This repo

The primary function of this repo is to provide a basic area from which I can host https://sohomdatta1.github.io, my personal profile. In addition to this, the [writeups](https://github.com/sohomdatta1/sohomdatta1.github.io/tree/main/writeups) directory stores writeups about CTF challenges and bugs that I have found.
