## Open-source experience

I co-maintain Wikimedia open-source projects like [PageTriage](https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PageTriage), which helps combat spam articles, and the [ProofreadPage](https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ProofreadPage) and Wikisource extensions that are used in the Wikisource digital library. I also maintain a few other tools to optimize editor workflows.

## Roles at Wikimedia

I currently serve as a member of the [Product and Technology Advisory Council](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Product_and_Technology_Advisory_Council) (PTAC). I am an administrator on the English Wikipedia where I help fix technical problems and fight spam on wiki. I've previously served as a Google Summer of Code Mentor during 2021 and 2024 and a Google Summer of Code Organization administrator in 2023.

## What I do

When I'm not tinkering with tech, I like to spend my time doing photography and writing about [computer security topics at Wikimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sohom_Datta). I infrequently post cool pictures that I might have taken on Commons.

All pictures released by me on social media should be considered to be under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) unless noted otherwise. This means that you should provide attribution if you plan to use the pictures anywhere other than for your own personal use.
